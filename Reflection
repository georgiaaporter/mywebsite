<title>My Reflection<title>
<p>Understanding the Contour556 website, such as audience, age, gender, 
geography, culture background, and education background, was the first 
step in the product development process. All of this was valuable information 
to have since it influenced my idea of how my website should be built and targeted. 
The website is directed towards people over the age of 18, with a minimalistic 
design and a light pink colour palette. After seeing the Contour556 website, 
I began my approach by looking at other websites that are similar to the 
concept I want to apply. This investigation was successful since I came across 
a number of websites that inspired me, including https://newyorkspa.com.au/ 
and https://events.canberra.com.au/. The New York Spa website influenced me 
with its layout and colour theme. Whereas, events.canberra website gave me ideas 
with its use of text format and use of bold fonts as the titles. These elements 
can be noticeable in my website for the Contour556 website.</P>

<p>Meanwhile, low-fidelity prototyping was used to help me get my ideas down 
on paper and determine the design of the website's flow and structure. My 
original prototype was deemed too complex for me to code, so I switched to 
a simpler style and grid. Despite the fact that the grid on my prototype is 
not identical to the one on my website, it is apparent that they both have 
the same top-to-bottom layout. This low-fidelity prototyping was beneficial 
in that it assisted me in making fundamental layout decisions and I could look 
back at it for inspiration.</p>

<p>Starting the process of putting my project into final development, I 
looked at the modules for information and looked for youtube videos, 
including "How To Make Website Using HTML & CSS" by Easy Tutorials, because 
I didn't know much about html and css coding. Generally, the recordings 
on modules were helpful in looking back and using the coding on my own 
ebsite. Furthermore, the coding of the tabs and photos went smoothly, 
and I was able to change them to the proper sizes and places on the page. 
The YouTube videos are a source of information for making the website 
responsive, including phone layout and coding for buttons and effects. 
This can be observed on the menu page, which features two photographs that 
have an effect when you press on them a text appears. All these features 
took an amount of time to understand in css coding. This would be displayed 
on Github, but it won't be since I've never used Github before, and coding 
is frightening enough for a beginner. If I could change one thing about 
this project, it would be to comment on Github throughout the website process. 
Overall, for a beginner coder it was not easy and quick and learning it is 
important to understand what the codes mean before hand taking on the final 
project. Finally, the finished design of my website for Contour5666 was 
successful, in which it uses css and html coding as well as the css responds 
to mobile devices. My Contour556 website is for all genders, art students 
and designers with an interest in Canberra's landscape.</p>
